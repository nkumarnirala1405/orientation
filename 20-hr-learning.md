# 20 hour learning by Josh Kaufman

As proposed by kaufmann, rapid skill acquisition has 4 steps:  
1. **Deconstructing** a skill into the smallest possible sub-skills.
2. **Learning** enough about each subskill to be able to practice intelligently and self-correct during practice.
3. **Removing** physical,mental and emotional barriers that get in the way of practice. 
4. **Practicing** the most important subskills for at least twenty hours.

### Getting Decently Good vs Expert level

Following are the two graphs that depict the relationships between two sets of variables:

1. **Performance time _vs_ Practice time**

## Effective Learning

Skill is the result of deliberate, consistent practice and in early-stage practice, quantity and speed trump absolute quality. The faster and more often you practice, the more rapidly youâ€™ll acquire the skill. (Important to know that this is only true at the beginning, skill improvement requires careful practice)

Ten major principles of effective learning are as follows:  
1. Research the skill and related topics.
2. Jump in over your head.
3. Identify mental models and mental hooks.
4. Imagine the opposite of what you want.
5. Talk to practitioners to set expectations
6. Eliminate distractions in your environment.
7. Use spaced repetition and reinforcement for memorization.
8. Create scaffolds and checklists.
9. Make and test predictions.
10. Honor your biology.

## Conclusion

The major barrier to learning a new skill is not intellect or the supposedly tedious practicing process but rather it is emotion; your tendency to doubt yourself about really being able to learn the skill. You need to overcome this barrier and set the aim of initially practicing for at least 20 hours and eventually mastering the skill through dedicated and deliberate practice.
