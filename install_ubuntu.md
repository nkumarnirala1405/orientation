Ubuntu 18.04 or any other version of Linux is strictly not supported by us

**Why Ubuntu 16.04 and Not Ubuntu xx.xx ?**
We have solved all possible issues on 16.04 and there are many issues in 18.04 and 20.04 
which we don't want to get busy solving since our main goal is our curriculum and not solving Ubuntu or other Linux issues.
