Want to join IoTIoT.in ?

How to read this document ? 


You must have atleast 2-3 hours of free time, stable internet, atleast 2gb usb disk ,to complete all steps given here.

You will have to read carefully , understand and do things .

This basic document itself helps you move from student to professional level .

So please approach this with professionalism. Dont try to somehow complete tasks here like any other college assignment.


The pre-requsities

## Step 1 : Install Ubuntu 16.04 on your Laptop 
Ubuntu 18.04 or any other version of Linux is strictly not supported by us
**Why **?We have solved all possible issues on 16.04 and there are many issues in 18.04 
which we dont want to get busy solving since our main goal is our curriculum and not solving Ubuntu or other linux issues.

We have documents explaining stuff

1. [How to Install Ubuntu(dual boot)](/extras/Dual_Boot_PC.pdf)

## Step 2(a) : Learn how to use git 

Please follow this [guide](git_basics.md) to git

Optional : To learn more about git, Check out this [guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

## Step 2(b) : Learn how to use Gitlab
We do all our work inside Gitlab.
Every task that is assigned to you has to be a gitlab issue.

Learn about [Issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/) here.

Write a Summary on "Gitlab Issues" and add it to your branch in git. (You know the drill) :)

## Step 3 : See 20hr Learning video

20hr Learning [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY)

Please write a Summary of the video. Write concise, the lesser the better but must cover all key points.

Name it 20hr-learning-summary.md

Before doing the practical, Ensure you have completed all the steps given [here](Register.md).

You will only be able to perform point 6 if you get approved by the Admin.

### Practical -Your real test here

1. Clone this repository - https://gitlab.iotiot.in/newbies/iotiot.in-on-boarding.git
2. Create a branch with branch name = "Your Full Name"
3. Run check.sh script
4. Add the Summary of the Video to the repository (20hr-learning-summary.md)
5. Commit all your changes (include all  files in your directory)
6. Push the changes to the remote repository

## Step 4 : Learn About the culture of our company

1. We have a very flat culture.No hierarchy, if you are part of any team , 
you must be told the goal you are working towards , your task cannot be a just a task you are asked to complete.
2. You are accountable for your task/issue.
3. You should be empathetic in your documentation (make it super easy for 
others to understand with diagrams flow charts and minimal bookish language)
4.Please donot work in college assignment mode.


We have a daily review at 4:00 pm everyday.This is where you tell us what goal you are working towards and what challenges you faced today and how we can help you with those.

#### Pre-requisites for Daily review

Before giving the daily review ensure that 

1. The work that you have done on that day is an issue in gitlab in respective project.
2. Issues should have correct meaningful Description. 
3. Summary of the day should be documented the 20 hour learning way, inside the issue.

Your earn your karma points only if your daily review follows all steps .
