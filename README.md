## Step 1 : Get tools for the program
We use Ubuntu 16.04 as our default OS. Please install it on to your system, so
that you can work with us.

(put up a good overview of gitlab)

## Step 2 (b) : Learn how to use git 
Git is the way we manage code and there is no software development without git.

## Step 3 : Learn About the culture of our company
Culture is more important for us than code.

****Know our mission :**** [IoTIoT.in Vision & Mission](http://bit.ly/iotiotvision)

1. We have a very flat culture. No hierarchy, if you are part of any team, 
you must be told the goal you are working towards, your task cannot be a just a 
task you are asked to complete.
2. You are accountable for your task/issue.
3. You should be empathetic in your documentation (make it super easy for 
others to understand with diagrams flow charts and minimal bookish language)
4. Please don't work in college assignment mode.
