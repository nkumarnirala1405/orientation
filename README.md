> **Innovation is seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought**.  
Famous quote by Dr. Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi, discovered Vitamin C.

Our Key **Innovations** are our **Processes** .We have arranged common course material in a structured way learnt by training over 300 students and optimised to anchor core concepts and master the subject by doing  practical assignments.

## Step 1 : Learn About the culture of our company

****Know our mission :**** [IoTIoT.in Vision & Mission](http://bit.ly/iotiotvision)

1. We have a very flat culture. No hierarchy, if you are part of any team, 
you must be told the goal you are working towards, your task cannot be a just a 
task you are asked to complete.
2. You take ownership for your task/issue.
3. You should be empathetic in your documentation (make it super easy for 
others to understand with diagrams flow charts and minimal bookish language)
4. Be **open minded** to learn new ways and **persistent** to complete things you take up .

## Step 2: New approach towards learning - 20hrs learning method 
We are a startup and we have an innovative approach to Learning.  
Watch the video on [20 hr Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY).  
We follow this approach throughout our learning process.  

## Step 3 : Using Same OS to avoid OS issues
We use Ubuntu 16.04 as our default OS. Please install it on to your system, so
that you can work with us.  

Learn how to install Ubuntu 16.04 in this [guide](install_ubuntu.md) 

## Step 4 (a) : Learn how to use git 
Git is the way we manage code and there is no software development without git.  
Please follow this [guide](git_basics.md)

## Step 4 (b) : Learn how to use GitLab

We do all our work inside GitLab. And knowing the interface will help you get around.  

Learn about [Issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/) here.
(put up a good overview of gitlab)



## Step 4 (c) : Learn how to document like experienced developers
Experienced developers write documentation in Markdown.  

Learn Markdown by following this interactive [Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/lesson/1/)

## Step 4 (d) : [Learn Docker basics](docker_basics.md)

## Step 4 (e) : [Coding Style](coding_style.md)

## Step 5 : Practical - Your real test here
1. Register & request Access to the project, [guide here](Register.md) 
2. Clone this repository - https://gitlab.iotiot.in/newbies/orientation.git
3. Create a branch with branch name = "Your Full Name"
4. Add the Summaries on the topics  
   1. Gitlab Interface (gitlab-interface.md)
    1. Git Basics (git-basics.md)
    1. 20 hr Learning Video (20-hr-learning.md)

**Note** : Summaries should be concise, the lesser the better but must cover all key points. Summaries should be written in Markdown.
